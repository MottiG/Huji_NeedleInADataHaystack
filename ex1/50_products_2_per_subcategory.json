        "Description": "Offering everything a recreational diver wants, and everything a technical diver needs, the M2 (MANTIS 2) is a wristwatch-style dive computer like no other. The M2 is loaded with topside features and underwater functions, including hoseless air integration and electronic navigation, plus it incorporates cutting-edge biometrics through Human Factor Diving™ that enable you to live your life in dive mode.\n \nHuman Factor Diving™ is an exclusive SCUBAPRO approach to equipment design that combines Human Factors & Ergonomics  (an engineering doctrine that focuses on the interaction between products and the people who use them), Biometrics (the science of measuring and analyzing a person's biological data), and Wearable Technology (gear designed to be worn on the body) to create high-tech scuba diving products that are compact, easy to use and, MOST importantly, provide detailed \"real-time\" self-tracking reports on how your body is functioning, both on the surface and at depth, so you can get the most out of your body, out of your dive, and out of your life.\nThe M2 is the newest example of SCUBAPRO's Human Factor Diving™ computer design, and it stands at the pinnacle of go-anywhere, do-anything, \"intelligent\" personal dive computing.\nWhat makes the M2 the ultimate \"intelligent\" personal dive computer is its ability to incorporate your personal data into workload computations at a level unmatched in modern dive computing. Through the use of biometrics and other technological advances, you are now able to maximize your body's operational efficiency. You can be alerted when you're over-exerting, enabling you to avoid potential problems before they escalate into major events.\nOffering a totally customized dive computing system, the M2 features a visually pleasing display screen, an intuitive menu and a simple circular navigation system, making it one of the most user-friendly dive computers on the market.\nIt looks great too. The casing is made of the highest marine-grade 316L stainless steel. The attractively machined bezel ring features engraved button labels and decorative hash marks. The black inner face ring on the display enables the mode indicators to stand out for easy reading, adding a pleasing contrast to the LCD display.\nThe alphanumeric characters and graphics are well-ordered and easy to read. The four metal control buttons allow for easy navigation through the system's intuitive menu. For leak-proof reliability, each button is assembled in a module using triple O-rings.\nFor daily topside use the M2 offers full timekeeping functions. For after-work sports and exercise, the altimeter and thermometer let you track hiking excursions into the upper elevations. The chronograph with lap memory is great for running, and it's also possible to record your swimming time, number of swim strokes and swimming distance.\nWhen it's time to go diving, the M2 is the most advanced personal dive computer on the market. It starts with hoseless air integration that can handle multiple transmitters. The digital tilt-compensated compass offers easy navigation under water or on the surface. The HRM belt lets you monitor your heart rate at depth -- another SCUBAPRO exclusive. The HRM belt also measures your skin temperature which can be factored into your decompression algorithm for safer, more efficient diving.\nWith a maximum operating depth of 394ft/120m, the M2 has four underwater modes: Scuba, Gauge, Freediving and CCR. Its UWATEC ZHL-8 Predictive Multi-Gas algorithm can accommodate three gas mixes, from 21 percent nitrox to 100 percent O2, plus offers a fixed PPO2 CCR algorithm for closed circuit rebreather diving. The M2 comes with a full dive planner and countdown timer in Scuba mode. For data downloading, LogTRAK software for both PC and Mac is included, and there's a LogTRAK app for use on Android phones.\nHuman Factor Diving™ is the future of dive equipment design and development. Look to the future and you find SCUBAPRO.\n \nThere are dive computers, and then there is the M2. Try one out and you'll immediately see the difference SCUBAPRO engineering and technology makes.",

        "Description": "X1 Blade Fins \nUltimate POWER with Every Kick\nX1 BladeFin Design\nLegendary Atomic Aquatics design and quality.\n1. Rigid Low-Profile Side Rails and Shorter, Stiffer Blade-Makes turning and pivoting easier. Most fins have taller side rails for tracking and bending strength. The Atomic X1 BladeFin has lower profile rails with less side-to-side resistance that allow you to rotate, spin and turn more efficiently during alternate fin kicks.2. Monocoque Structure and Power Plate-Unique structural engineering design is connected to the low-profile rails, efficiently transferring power from the leg and foot to the rails.3. Asymmetrical Blade Bend Flexing-This design attribute is perfect for alternate kicking styles. Scissor kicks, frog-kicking and helicopter turning in tight circles put more emphasis on the up-kick or return stroke. For these kick styles, the X1 provides more feel and control of the fin to maneuver more effectively without folding under heavy load.4. Vertical Stabilizers or Strakes- Adds stability and lowers drag to keep the fin tracking straight as an arrow. Other fin designs use taller side rails to keep the fin tracking straight. By using strakes to straighten the fin, the X1 BladeFin does not add significant side drag like tall side rails.\nX1 BladeFin Kicking Styles\nOptimal performance for general purpose diving and alternate kicking styles.The X1 BladeFin has the backbone to control and maneuver in tight spaces, perfect for alternate kicking styles such as helicopter, scissors, backwards, flutter and frog-kicks. Another design attribute of the X1 BladeFin that contributes to improved alternate kicking styles is asymmetrical blade bend flexing which provides more feel and control of the fin to maneuver more effectively without folding.EZ-LOK Buckle SystemEasily snap the buckle on and off. And be confident that it will not release accidentally. Buckles rotate 180 degrees and straps adjust with a simple pull. Standard on all X1 BladeFins.\nTaller Foot Pocket DesignThe X1 BladeFin foot pocket design is taller with low-friction entry sections inside the pocket, perfect for large boots and drysuit boots.\nWarranty & CareAtomic Aquatics fins are warranted against defects for a period of one year. Keep out of direct sunlight when possible to avoid color fading. Store your fins with the foot pocket inserts in place and in a manner that prevents deforming.",
